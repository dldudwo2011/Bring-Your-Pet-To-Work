## Instructions

Clone a copy of this repository to your device so that you can develop it locally. When you finish, make sure to push your latest commit to GitHub Classroom. 

For this Lab, you will create a responsive signup form for a fictitious tech startup. For ease of use and legibility, we will be building several views: 

1. We will begin with the narrowest view (mobile view).

2. Next, we will write a media query that flexes the web form when there is enough room to render the inputs and labels side-by-side.

3. After, we will write a media query that swaps the background image and flexes our form and marketing copy beside the image. 

4. Finally, we will write a media query that stops the layout from growing beyond a certain width. 

However, before you begin, you must prepare your content. Your first task will be to write valid, semantic HTML; next, you will need to convert your background images to an appropriate filetype and ensure that they are no greater than 250KB each.

This Lab will be  a Code-A-Long where you will be expected to put in the final touches on your own.
